# Spectrum — Colours, Shapes & First Steps

A series of short pieces built from colour, instinct, and escape: the starting point of Phonophasm as an audio-visual experiment.

Spectrum (2021) is an early exploration in **freeform songwriting** and **abstract drawing**, created during the slow, uncertain rhythm of Covid. Each track grew from simple colour-focused sketches and unplanned ideas, letting sound and shape evolve together as a way to **let go**, experiment, and discover what Phonophasm could be.

## Overview

Spectrum began while life was shrinking indoors and time felt strange.

The approach was deliberately simple:

- Draw quick, instinctive shapes with no rules.
- Let each drawing suggest a mood, palette, or movement.
- Turn that feeling into sound in the same sitting—no overthinking.

The result is a set of compact tracks that link directly to colours and impressions rather than concepts or lyrics: a small but important first step into treating **music and visuals as one process** instead of two separate outputs.

## Process

Key elements of how Spectrum was made:

- **Abstract sketching**  
  Loose, minimal drawings in different colours became anchors for each piece—more like emotional cues than storyboards.
- **Freeform writing & recording**  
  Guitars, keys, textures, and noise were layered quickly, following instinct instead of structure.
- **Emotional snapshot**  
  Rather than making “lockdown music” about anxiety or explanation, Spectrum became an **escape into colour**, a quiet space to explore inner states without needing words.

This workflow—visual prompt → sonic response—became the foundation for later Phonophasm projects.

## Sound & Visuals

- Short tracks mapped to specific colours (Purple, Pink, Blue, Cyan, etc.), each treated as a tiny self-contained world.
- Simple, textural sound design focused on:
  - gentle movement,
  - layered tones,
  - a feeling of drifting through a palette rather than a fixed song form.
- Visuals were kept minimal and handmade, reinforcing the idea that **playful, imperfect creation** is valid and valuable.

## Why Spectrum Matters

Spectrum is the **origin point**:

- First conscious attempt to bind drawing + sound into a single creative habit.
- Opens the thread that runs through later work:
  - Focal Point,
  - Neo-Sense VR,
  - Matsu VR,
  - PhonoSPHERE and future instruments.
- Serves as a reminder that much of your practice is about:
  - spontaneity,
  - emotion through abstraction,
  - and building immersive experiences from very simple beginnings.
