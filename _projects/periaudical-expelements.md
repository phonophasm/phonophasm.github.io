# Periaudical Expelements — Elements, Frequencies & Early Worlds

A continuation of abstract experiments: using the periodic table, binaural frequencies, and early NFT-era visuals to sketch out a more defined Phonophasm universe.

## TL;DR

Periaudical Expelements (2022) builds on Spectrum’s abstract process, this time using **chemical elements** and **binaural frequencies** as loose guides for each piece.  
It runs parallel with early steps into **digital artwork, NFTs, and The AV Club**, where audio-visual artists shared work, built galleries, and explored new ways of presenting their work.

---

## Overview

Where Spectrum was pure instinct, Periaudical Expelements adds a playful system:

- Each track is linked to an **element** from the periodic table.
- Element numbers loosely inform **frequencies** and binaural beat structures.
- Visuals and titles echo microscopic structures, reactions, and imagined “expelements”.

The album becomes a lab:

- a place to test structure without losing spontaneity,
- a step deeper into pairing **sound + visual identity**,
- and an early move toward a recognisable Phonophasm language.

## Process & Concept

Core ingredients:

- **Periodic Table as Framework**  
  Element associations act as prompts: guiding tone, density, or rhythm rather than enforcing strict rules.
- **Binaural & Textural Experiments**  
  Binaural-style layers and detuned voices create gentle perceptual shifts—suggesting inner movement and chemical drift.
- **Improvised Structures**  
  Many tracks began as intuitive performances, refined just enough to keep their experimental feel.

This phase also marked:

- more intentional **branding and consistency**,
- integrating artwork, titles, and sonics into a shared visual/sound world,
- and taking first steps into presenting work in curated, digital-native spaces.

## Visuals, NFTs & The AV Club

Periaudical Expelements sits inside your early exploration of crypto art and community.

- **Visual Pairings**  
  Abstract, element-inspired pieces built as companions to each track.
- **The AV Club**  
  A hosted space where audio-visual NFT artists:
  - shared process,
  - discussed tools and platforms,
  - collaborated on releases, gallery builds, and experiments.
- **Galleries & Drops**  
  Involvement in virtual galleries and multi-platform releases helped shape how Phonophasm is framed as both **sound** and **visual practice**.

## Tools & Workflow

Periaudical Expelements was also a technical playground.

**Audio**

- **Logic Pro** – main environment for writing, recording, arranging, and mixing.
- **Instruments**:
  - MIDI keyboard + sampled instruments
  - Real electric guitar and bass
  - Layered vocals and vocal textures
- **Effects** – delays, reverbs, modulation, and subtle processing to create depth and evolving tonal spaces.

**Visuals & Motion**

- **TouchDesigner** – early experiments in real-time, audio-reactive visuals.
- **Blender** – 3D forms and rendered elements for abstract “element worlds”.
- **Procreate** – hand-drawn textures, symbols, and sketches.
- **Resolume** – live/looping playback and performance tests.
- **Magic Music Visuals** – generative, music-driven forms.
- **Final Cut Pro** – editing promos, loops, and gallery materials.

This toolchain quietly set the foundation for later VR and interactive work, where code, sound, and image are treated as one connected system.

## Why Periaudical Expelements Matters

Within your wider practice, this project:

- Extends the **audio-visual link** seeded in Spectrum.
- Experiments with **rule-based abstraction** (elements, frequencies) that foreshadow:
  - generative systems,
  - interactive installations,
  - and VR instruments.
- Marks the moment you:
  - engaged publicly as *Phonophasm*,
  - built artist networks,
  - and treated each release as part of a continuous, evolving body of work.

It stands as both a self-contained album and a **bridge** to your later AV, VR, and research-led projects.
