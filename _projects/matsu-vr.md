# Matsu VR — Memories and Stories from the Matsu Islands

![Concept hero illustration for the Matsu VR project, combining island landscapes and interview quotes.](/assets/projects/Matsu/hero.png)

A VR-led exhibition concept that translates lived memories, interviews, and local myths from the Matsu Islands into an immersive, story-driven experience.

Matsu VR is a narrative VR journey and exhibition framework built from real interviews, field recordings, and research on the Matsu Islands. It weaves VR, documentary, print, and feedback tools into one experience designed to share Matsunese identity and gently encourage cultural tourism and deeper understanding. Field expeditions across Nangan and Beigan gathered ambient audio, photographs, and handwritten stories that became the raw material for every virtual scene.

## What it is

Matsu VR began as a research and exhibition project at NCKU, exploring how immersive media can represent the distinct cultural identity of the Matsu Islands.

Key ideas:

- **Identity through stories** – The project treats Matsu as defined by the memories, rituals, humour, and daily life of its people rather than by borders or slogans.
- **From tech demo to storytelling** – Early fantasy-heavy prototypes evolved into grounded, interview-based scenes that stay close to real people and places.
- **Multi-layered experience** – VR is the gateway, supported by documentary content, printed materials, and a feedback station to complete the narrative loop.

## Experience Design

During fieldwork the team mapped how physical spaces, personal stories, and exhibition touchpoints should flow together. That layout became a living blueprint for the VR build and the on-site installation.

The visitor journey is structured around four pillars:

1. **Inspire — VR Experience**
   Visitors enter a stylised virtual Matsu built from interviews, environmental audio, and photographic references. Each scene is tied to a real story or memory, guiding people to *feel* the islands before they analyse them.

2. **Relate — Documentary**
   A short art-documentary (and in-progress edits) presents the people behind the stories—fishers, residents, storytellers—anchoring the VR experience in real faces and voices.

3. **Inform — Booklet & Visuals**
   Printed materials and exhibition graphics introduce history, geography, and cultural notes, giving visitors context without overloading the VR narrative.

4. **Engage — Feedback Station**
   Participants are invited to share reflections, draw connections to their own “islands,” and suggest how Matsu should be represented. This feedback becomes new material for future iterations.

## How the VR Works (Conceptually)

- **Scene-based journey** – Visitors move through key locations and memory fragments: harbours, religious sites, domestic spaces, and symbolic landscapes.
- **Memory anchors** – Short voice extracts and text fragments (from interviews and fieldwork) act as anchors for each scene.
- **Gentle interaction** – Simple gaze and position-based triggers reveal layers of story rather than fast-paced “game” mechanics, keeping focus on atmosphere and reflection.
- **Emotional arc** – The flow moves from curiosity → familiarity → reflection, asking what makes Matsu “Matsunese” rather than simply “Taiwanese” or “Chinese”.

The Unity build layers field recordings with interactive memory tokens, mirroring the same sequence of spaces documented during the site visits and interviews.

## Process

From the first ferry rides between islands to late-night transcription sessions, the workflow moved in tight feedback loops. Field documentation fed quick VR sketches, which were then tested with residents and iterated into exhibition-ready prototypes.

**Stage 1 – Fieldwork & Research**
- Trip to the Matsu Islands
- Interviews, surveys, on-site photography and audio recording
- First VR/worldbuilding experiments exploring atmosphere and symbolism
- Community mapping sessions with residents comparing everyday routes to visitor perceptions

**Stage 2 – Prototyping & Exhibition**
- Initial VR demo and exhibition tests
- Early feedback: increase local specificity, reduce abstract/AI-heavy elements
- Adjustment of visual language and narrative structure
- Rapid paper and VR prototyping to translate interview quotes into interactive beats

**Stage 3 – Story-Driven Refinement**
- Rewriting scenes around direct quotes and memories
- Integrating documentary, booklet, and feedback elements into a single exhibition framework
- Technical polish on navigation, interaction cues, and performance
- Playtesting with Matsunese diaspora to balance interactivity with contemplative pacing

## Tech & Tools

- Engine: Unity (VR prototype)
- Platform: Meta Quest (standalone)
- Media: 360/flat video, stills, ambisonic/field recordings, voice clips
- Exhibition: VR stations, looping documentary screen, printed booklet, feedback wall

## Why it matters

Matsu VR is less about spectacle and more about **representation**:

- Offers an alternative to purely promotional tourism media by centering real voices.
- Demonstrates how VR + documentary + print can work together as one narrative system.
- Provides a framework for future projects that use immersive media to explore contested identities, small-island cultures, and borderland stories.

## What’s next

- Finalise a public-ready build for exhibition and festivals.
- Expand the library of stories and locations in collaboration with Matsunese communities.
- Explore bilingual/translated versions for international audiences.
- Use this workflow as a template for future culturally focused VR projects.
