# Oscillations — Drawing with Soundwaves

An experimental album built from numbers, shapes, and oscilloscope music: exploring how **sound looks** and how **images can sing**.

Oscillations is a collection of pieces generated from a single TXT-based image using an oscilloscope music tool (Oscirender). By converting shapes and coordinates into audio, then layering and processing the results, the project blurs the line between **visual composition** and **sound design**, and extends your journey into tightly bound audio-visual thinking.

## Overview

Oscillations asks a simple question:

> If a drawing becomes a soundwave, can we compose music by designing how it looks?

Using Oscirender and a single source file, you:

- turned coordinates and line data into raw waveforms,
- sculpted these into evolving tones, drones, and movements,
- and treated the oscilloscope visual not as a by-product, but as part of the composition.

The result is an album where:

- each track is visually traceable,
- and each sound has a structural, graphical origin.

## Process & Concept

Key ideas behind Oscillations:

- **One Image, Many Worlds**
  Starting from a single TXT image, different parameter changes, render passes, and processing chains created multiple distinct sonic outcomes.
- **Visual-to-Audio Mapping**
  Lines and shapes become waveforms; curvature and density influence pitch, movement, and texture.
- **Layering & Restraint**
  Rather than building from traditional instruments, you focused on:
  - layering oscilloscope-derived tones,
  - subtle effects,
  - dynamic changes over time.

These explorations are documented through process screenshots captured inside Oscirender and Logic Pro. They show the oscilloscope interface translating geometric drawings into XY audio, the recording setup with oscilloscope plugins, and early experiments with basic shape generators that informed how you sculpted the first tones.

This was less about traditional songwriting and more about:

- **listening to geometry**,
- exploring the poetic space between diagrams, screens, and drone music,
- and deepening your fascination with generative / system-based creation.

## Tools & Workflow

**Core Engine**

- **Oscirender** – converting TXT-based shapes into oscilloscope music / XY audio.
- **Logic Pro** – arranging, layering, processing, and finalising each piece.

**Sound Sources**

- Oscilloscope-generated signals as the primary voice.
- Additional processing via:
  - EQ, saturation, modulation, spatial effects,
  - gentle layering to keep the focus on waveform character.

**Visuals**

- Oscilloscope views and render outputs as:
  - cover art elements,
  - looping visuals,
  - documentation of how each track “looks” when decoded.

(You can embed GIFs or screenshots here.)

## Audio-Visual Pieces

The finished Oscillations tracks grew from the same numeric datasets that shaped the visuals. You mapped lists of coordinates and numerical patterns into stereo XY signals, then layered the resulting oscillations with complementary effects derived from those numbers—filters keyed to specific values, modulation depths pulled from data sequences, and dynamic automation shaped by the geometry. Over the top, you improvised vocals in direct response to the evolving waveforms, treating the generated sound as a conversation partner.

These stills capture a slice of those finished outputs:

## NFTs & Digital Art

Oscillations was also released as a series of NFTs on objkt.com, extending the concept:

- **Audio-visual tokens** where:
  - the sound and its visual origin are inherently linked,
  - collectors receive a snapshot of this experiment in translating shapes → sound.
- **On-chain documentation** of this phase in your practice.

**NFT / Gallery Links (placeholders):**

- [View Oscillations collection on objkt.com](https://example.com)

(Add real links when ready.)

## Why Oscillations Matters

Oscillations marks an important step in your evolution:

- Moves further away from traditional band structures into **system-driven, code-adjacent composition**.
- Strengthens the idea that:
  - images can be instruments,
  - rules and data can be creative collaborators.
- Lays conceptual groundwork for:
  - VR instruments like **PhonoSPHERE**,
  - interactive visual music systems,
  - and later research into how people perceive and navigate audio-visual spaces.

It is both a standalone experimental release and a clear link in the chain toward your current immersive and research-led work.
