# Oscillations — Drawing with Soundwaves

An experimental album built from numbers, shapes, and oscilloscope music: exploring how **sound looks** and how **images can sing**.

Oscillations is a collection of pieces generated from a single TXT-based image using an oscilloscope music tool (Oscirender). By converting shapes and coordinates into audio, then layering and processing the results, the project blurs the line between **visual composition** and **sound design**, and extends your journey into tightly bound audio-visual thinking.

## Overview

Oscillations asks a simple question:

> If a drawing becomes a soundwave, can we compose music by designing how it looks?

Using Oscirender and a single source file, you:

- turned coordinates and line data into raw waveforms,
- sculpted these into evolving tones, drones, and movements,
- and treated the oscilloscope visual not as a by-product, but as part of the composition.

The result is an album where:

- each track is visually traceable,
- and each sound has a structural, graphical origin.

## Process & Concept

Key ideas behind Oscillations:

- **One Image, Many Worlds**
  Starting from a single TXT image, different parameter changes, render passes, and processing chains created multiple distinct sonic outcomes.
- **Visual-to-Audio Mapping**
  Lines and shapes become waveforms; curvature and density influence pitch, movement, and texture.
- **Layering & Restraint**
  Rather than building from traditional instruments, you focused on:
  - layering oscilloscope-derived tones,
  - subtle effects,
  - dynamic changes over time.

This was less about traditional songwriting and more about:

- **listening to geometry**,
- exploring the poetic space between diagrams, screens, and drone music,
- and deepening your fascination with generative / system-based creation.

## Tools & Workflow

**Core Engine**

- **Oscirender** – converting TXT-based shapes into oscilloscope music / XY audio.
- **Logic Pro** – arranging, layering, processing, and finalising each piece.

**Sound Sources**

- Oscilloscope-generated signals as the primary voice.
- Additional processing via:
  - EQ, saturation, modulation, spatial effects,
  - gentle layering to keep the focus on waveform character.

**Visuals**

- Oscilloscope views and render outputs as:
  - cover art elements,
  - looping visuals,
  - documentation of how each track “looks” when decoded.

## NFTs & Digital Art

Oscillations was also released as a series of NFTs on objkt.com, extending the concept:

- **Audio-visual tokens** where:
  - the sound and its visual origin are inherently linked,
  - collectors receive a snapshot of this experiment in translating shapes → sound.
- **On-chain documentation** of this phase in your practice.

**NFT / Gallery Links (placeholders):**

- [View Oscillations collection on objkt.com](https://example.com)

(Add real links when ready.)

## Why Oscillations Matters

Oscillations marks an important step in your evolution:

- Moves further away from traditional band structures into **system-driven, code-adjacent composition**.
- Strengthens the idea that:
  - images can be instruments,
  - rules and data can be creative collaborators.
- Lays conceptual groundwork for:
  - VR instruments like **PhonoSPHERE**,
  - interactive visual music systems,
  - and later research into how people perceive and navigate audio-visual spaces.

It is both a standalone experimental release and a clear link in the chain toward your current immersive and research-led work.
