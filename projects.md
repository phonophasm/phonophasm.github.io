Hi — I’m Pete. I make music, VR instruments, and new‑media experiments.

## Projects

### VR & Interactive Projects

<div class="card">
  <h3 style="margin:0;">PhonoSPHERE VR Instrument</h3>
  <p>PhonoSPHERE is an in-development VR musical instrument for Quest headsets. Notes and sounds are embedded in spatial objects that respond to hand movement and proximity, enabling embodied, exploratory performance. It also serves as a prototype environment for future bio/neurofeedback-driven control experiments.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3 style="margin:0;">NeoSense VR</h3>
  <p>NeoSense VR investigates sensory manipulation and “sense swapping” in VR. The project focuses on how altered sensory mappings influence search performance, perception, and user comfort, combining creative interaction design with structured user studies.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3 style="margin:0;">Matsu VR</h3>
  <p>Matsu VR is a narrative VR experience set around Taiwan’s Matsu Islands. It blends documentary-inspired imagery, spatial sound, and guided interaction to explore place, memory, and the emotional weight of borderland spaces.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3 style="margin:0;">Focal Point</h3>
  <p>Focal Point is an audio-visual project examining attention and distraction through slow-evolving soundscapes and minimal visuals. It operates as both a standalone work and a conceptual bridge between studio music, live performance, and interactive media.</p>
