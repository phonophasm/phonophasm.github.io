Hi — I’m Pete (Phonophasm).

I design and perform immersive audio-visual experiences, VR instruments, and interactive installations. My background combines engineering, music, and an MA in creative/interaction design, with recent work focusing on VR, sensory manipulation, and tools that support focus, reflection, and altered states of attention.

This site collects prototypes, research-driven projects, and music releases as I continue developing new instruments and immersive environments.
