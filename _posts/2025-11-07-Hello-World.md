## Who I am
I’m **Peter Harrison**, also known as **Phonophasm**—a musician, creative coder, and VR tinkerer from **Northern Ireland**, currently based in **Taiwan**. My practice sits at the intersection of music performance, interactive media, and playful experiments in extended reality.

I build instruments, write music with them, and share the process—warts and wins alike.

## Why I started this site
I wanted one place to document the projects I’m building, the sounds I’m exploring, and the lessons learned along the way. Expect a mix of short dev logs, process breakdowns, behind-the-scenes clips, and reflections on creative practice.

- Transparent builds (what worked, what broke, how I fixed it)
- Playable demos and performance notes
- Resources for fellow artists/devs who want to try similar things

## What I’m working on now
### PhonoSPHERE — my VR sampler instrument
I’m developing **PhonoSPHERE**, a **VR sampler + looper** for Meta Quest 3 with:
- **Key/scale mapping** so performances stay musical  
- **Multi-sample layering** for rich textures  
- **Passthrough MR** so I can see the band/audience while playing  
- **Up to 8 loop tracks** for building songs live  

See the project page for a fuller overview and screenshots.

### Explorination — the album I’m writing *inside* VR
Working title: **_Explorination_**. I’m composing it **using PhonoSPHERE**—treating the instrument as part of the songwriting process. Expect ambient textures, rhythmic loops, and a few left-turns born from happy accidents in VR.

- Sketches recorded live in MR  
- Iterative takes shaped by the instrument’s evolving features  
- Occasional posts sharing stems/snippets

## A little about my vibe
Curious. Systems-minded. I like turning constraints into design. I care about **clarity over flash**, **playability over perfection**, and the feeling when a tool melts away and the idea comes through. I’m also a teacher at heart—if I learn something useful, I’ll share it.

## What to expect next
- Short notes on PhonoSPHERE’s development (stability, UI decisions, looping workflow)
- Early demos from _Explorination_
- Guides and templates for VR music performance setups
