# VR Instrument Image Assets

Place the following images in this directory once they are ready. Use the exact filenames below so the project page links resolve correctly. JPEG files should be optimized (preferably below 500 KB each).

- `hero.jpg` — Wide banner/hero capture (≈1600×900 or larger)
- `ui-grid.jpg` — Key/scale grid or pad layout
- `passthrough.jpg` — Quest 3 passthrough view
- `looper.jpg` — 8-track looper UI
- `performance.jpg` — Live performance capture
- `process-sketch.jpg` — Early concept sketch or whiteboard
- `process-prototype.jpg` — First working prototype screenshot
- `process-iteration.jpg` — Recent build or iteration snapshot

After adding the images, no additional configuration is required; the project page references these filenames directly.
