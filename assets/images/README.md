# Project image placeholders

The home page references the following image files:

- `pete-portrait.png` – portrait photo for the hero section
- `phonosphere.png` – PhonoSPHERE featured project image
- `neo-sense.png` – Neo Sense featured project image
- `matsu.png` – Matsu featured project image
- `focal-point.png` – Focal Point featured project image

To avoid broken images, add your actual artwork or photos with those exact filenames in this directory. Square crops at roughly 800×800 work well—the site styles will automatically crop them into circles and scale them down on the page.
